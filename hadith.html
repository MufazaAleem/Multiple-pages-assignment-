            <p>Actions are but by intention, and every man shall have only that which he intended. Thus, he whose migration was for Allah and His messenger, his migration was for Allah and His messenger; and he whose migration was to achieve some worldly benefit or to take some woman in marriage, his migration was for that for which he migrated.</p>
